- review: Today’s experience was amazing! 🤩 you can really tell Claire loves massage and takes pride in what she’s doing. After a thorough consultation, Claire listened to my concerns and then proceeded with her hot stones magic . ✨ Set in a beautiful clinic, with a mixture of her aromatic oils and ambient music every element was simply devine. Recommending this cosy little space 100% and already looking forward to visiting again soon. Thank you!!

- review: I had a wonderful 2 hour massage with Claire today. She was so caring and attentive throughout. She took the time to carefully read my questionnaire beforehand and made sure the massage was completely tailored to my needs. I left feeling relaxed, cared for, and genuinely listened to. I’d highly recommend Claire to anyone looking for a thoughtful and professional massage experience.
